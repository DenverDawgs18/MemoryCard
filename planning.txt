Components I will need

Probably just a card component to be honest 
Goal for 3/18/24 -- Cards are not necessarily styled, but they are mostly done
Card pseudo code -
div
img
name
div
I might be way over simplifing but I don't think that seems bad at all
The images will need to be gathered from an API, goal for this morning might just be to make a call
There will need to be a function that randomly creates the 12 cards
There will need to be an array in state that keeps track of the cards ids, including which ones 
have been selected 
This will probably have a useEffect hook that is responsible for increasing the score state variable, 
or ending the game. When the game is ended, this will check if score is better than the current best score
(another state variable). If it is, setBestScore will be called, and then score will be cleared for a new game
